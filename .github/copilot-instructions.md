# ScreenSearch Chrome Extension

This is a Chrome extension project that allows users to:
1. Take screenshots of Chrome browser tabs
2. Crop those screenshots as needed
3. Send the images to an AI service for analysis
4. Display the AI's answers to questions about content in the images

When making changes, consider:
- Chrome extension manifest v3 guidelines
- Browser security restrictions for screenshots
- Canvas manipulation for image cropping
- API integration for AI image analysis
